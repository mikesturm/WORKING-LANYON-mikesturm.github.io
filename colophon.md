##What This Is

The favicon/sidebar icon on my site is excerpted from *Sta≈Ñczyk*, a painting by Jan Matejko. To me it portrays the plight of the modern fool (*read*: me). For an interesting explanation of this painting, and why it should be interesting to someone like you, dear reader, see [this piece](http://theoddmentemporium.tumblr.com/post/26715123339/image-sta%C5%84czyk-by-jan-matejko-the-jester-is), courtesy of [The Oddment Emporium](http://theoddmentemporium.tumblr.com/), which is worth checking out for its own sake.
