  Welcome! Thank you for visiting the vitrual home of your fool Laureate. 

I received my M.A. in Philosophy from Northern Illinois University in 2011. I spent over 4 years [teaching ethics and philosophy](http://www.mikesturm.net/philosophyteaching.html) at the college level, and am affiliated with [Kishwaukee College](http://www.kishwaukeecollege.edu/) in Malta, IL. I am a contributing member of the [Community College Humanities Association](http://www.ccha-assoc.org/). I now work for a burgeoning startup-style industrial distribution company in Rockford, IL, where I manage a fantastic team, and continue to keep my fingers in numerous cookie jars. I write (both here and at [Medium](https://medium.com/@MikeSturm)) about productivity, organization, leadership, and the pursuit of the good (a concept not often directly addressed in public life).

The icon on my site is excerpted from *Sta≈Ñczyk*, a painting by Jan Matejko. To me it portrays the plight of the modern fool (*read*: me). For an interesting explanation of this painting, and why it should be interesting to someone like you, dear reader, see [this piece](http://theoddmentemporium.tumblr.com/post/26715123339/image-sta%C5%84czyk-by-jan-matejko-the-jester-is), courtesy of [The Oddment Emporium](http://theoddmentemporium.tumblr.com/), which is worth checking out for its own sake.

To get a taste of what you can expect of my writing, below are a few of my most read posts.
