  Welcome! Thank you for visiting the vitrual home of the internet's youngest grumpy old man.
</p>

In all seriousness, my name is Mike Sturm. I received my M.A. in Philosophy from Northern Illinois University in 2011. I spent over 4 years [teaching ethics and philosophy](http://www.mikesturm.net/philosophyteaching.html) at the college level, and am affiliated with [Kishwaukee College](http://www.kishwaukeecollege.edu/) in Malta, IL. I am a contributing member of the [Community College Humanities Association](http://www.ccha-assoc.org/). I now work for a burgeoning startup-style industrial distribution company in Rockford, IL, where I manage a fantastic team, and continue to keep my fingers in numerous cookie jars. I write (both here and at [Medium](https://medium.com/@MikeSturm)) about productivity, organization, leadership, and the pursuit of the good (a concept not often directly addressed in public life).

To get a taste of what you can expect of my writing, below are a few of my most read posts.
